echo "=========================================="
echo ""
echo "1. Wait 10-15 minutes for the update to complete"
echo "2. Check AWS Lambda Console for function status"

echo "=================================="

echo "Check the Lambda function status manually:"

echo "1. Go to AWS Lambda Console:"
echo "   https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2#/functions/enhanced-auto-remediation-lambda-arm64"
echo ""
echo "2. Look for any error states or ongoing updates"

echo "=================="
echo ""
echo "1. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for the Lambda function update to complete"
echo "2. **Check AWS Lambda Console** for function status"
echo "3. **Re-run GitHub Actions workflow** once function is available"

echo "==================="
