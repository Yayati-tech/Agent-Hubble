## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured
- Appropriate IAM permissions for Security Hub, Lambda, and other AWS services
- SNS topic for notifications

### Quick Deployment

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivpa/aws-security-auto-remediation.git
   cd aws-security-auto-remediation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Deploy using the provided deployment scripts**:
   - `deploy-simple.sh` - Basic deployment
   - `deploy.sh` - Full deployment with CloudFormation
   - `deploy-arm64.sh` - ARM64 optimized deployment

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Simple Deployment
```bash
chmod +x deploy-simple.sh
./deploy-simple.sh
```

#### Option 2: Full Deployment
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

#### Option 3: ARM64 Deployment (Recommended for cost optimization)
```bash
chmod +x deploy-arm64.sh
./deploy-arm64.sh
```

#### Option 4: CloudFormation Deployment
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name security-auto-remediation \
  --template-body file://cloudformation-template.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `BACKUP_ACCOUNT_ID`: Backup account ID for cross-account operations
- `MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID`: Management account ID
- `SNS_TOPIC_NAME`: SNS topic name for notifications
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for deployment
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)
- `TIMEOUT`: Lambda function timeout in seconds
- `MEMORY_SIZE`: Lambda function memory size in MB

### IAM Permissions

The Lambda function requires permissions for:
- Security Hub (read, update findings)
- IAM (user, role, policy management)
- S3 (bucket configuration)
- EC2 (instance, volume, security group management)
- RDS (instance configuration)
- Lambda (function configuration)
- KMS (key management)
- CloudWatch (metrics and logs)
- SNS (notifications)
- And many other AWS services

## üîí Security Considerations

- The Lambda function requires appropriate IAM permissions
- Cross-account operations require proper role assumptions
- All remediations are logged and monitored
- Failed remediations are reported via SNS
- Environment variables should be encrypted
- Consider using AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration

## üìä Monitoring

### CloudWatch Metrics
- `RemediationSuccess`: Number of successful remediations
- `RemediationFailure`: Number of failed remediations
- `TotalRemediations`: Total number of remediations processed

### CloudWatch Logs
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Error tracking and debugging
- Performance monitoring

### SNS Notifications
- Success notifications for remediated findings
- Failure notifications for failed remediations
- Error notifications for system issues

### Security Hub Integration
- Automatic finding status updates
- Remediation tracking
- Compliance reporting

## üß™ Testing

### Test with Sample Findings

1. **Create a test Security Hub finding**
2. **Trigger the Lambda function**
3. **Monitor CloudWatch logs**
4. **Verify SNS notifications**
5. **Check Security Hub finding status**

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test the Lambda function locally
python -c "
import json
from enhanced_auto_remediation_lambda import lambda_handler

# Sample Security Hub event
event = {
    'detail': {
        'findings': [
            {
                'Id': 'test-finding-123',
                'Severity': {'Label': 'HIGH'},
                'ProductArn': 'arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2::product/aws/securityhub'
            }
        ]
    }
}

result = lambda_handler(event, None)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **IAM Permissions**: Ensure the Lambda role has all required permissions
2. **SNS Topic**: Verify the SNS topic exists and is accessible
3. **Environment Variables**: Check that all required environment variables are set
4. **Timeout Issues**: Increase the Lambda timeout for complex remediations
5. **Memory Issues**: Increase the Lambda memory for resource-intensive operations

### Debugging

1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**: Look for error messages and stack traces
2. **Verify SNS Notifications**: Ensure notifications are being sent
3. **Test Individual Functions**: Test specific remediation functions
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Check CloudWatch metrics for performance issues
