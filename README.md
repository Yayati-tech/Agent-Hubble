# AWS Security Auto-Remediation LambdannEnhanced AWS Security Hub auto-remediation Lambda function with cross-account capabilities and comprehensive security remediations.nn## Featuresnn- **Comprehensive Security Remediations**: Supports remediations for IAM, S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda, KMS, GuardDuty, Inspector, SSM, Macie, WAF, Shield, ACM, Secrets Manager, CloudFormation, API Gateway, ElastiCache, DynamoDB, EKS, ECR, ECS, Redshift, SageMaker, and Glue.n- **Cross-Account Capabilities**: Can remediate security findings across multiple AWS accounts.n- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging for production environments.n- **CloudWatch Integration**: Sends metrics and logs to CloudWatch for monitoring.n- **SNS Notifications**: Sends notifications for successful and failed remediations.n- **ARM64 Support**: Compatible with ARM64 architecture for cost optimization.nn## ArchitecturennThis Lambda function integrates with AWS Security Hub to automatically remediate security findings based on their severity and type. It supports:nn- **Multi-Service Remediations**: Coordinated remediations across multiple AWS servicesn- **Cross-Account Operations**: Remediation across different AWS accountsn- **Orchestrated Workflows**: Complex multi-step remediation processesnn## Deploymentnn### Prerequisitesnn- AWS CLI configuredn- Appropriate IAM permissions for Security Hub, Lambda, and other AWS servicesn- SNS topic for notificationsnn### Quick Deploymentnn1. Clone this repositoryn2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`n3. Deploy using the provided deployment scripts:n   - `deploy-simple.sh` - Basic deploymentn   - `deploy.sh` - Full deployment with CloudFormationn   - `deploy-arm64.sh` - ARM64 optimized deploymentnn## ConfigurationnnSet the following environment variables:nn- `BACKUP_ACCOUNT_ID`: Backup account ID for cross-account operationsn- `MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID`: Management account IDn- `SNS_TOPIC_NAME`: SNS topic name for notificationsnn## Security Considerationsnn- The Lambda function requires appropriate IAM permissionsn- Cross-account operations require proper role assumptionsn- All remediations are logged and monitoredn- Failed remediations are reported via SNSnn## Monitoringnn- CloudWatch metrics for remediation success/failure ratesn- SNS notifications for remediation eventsn- Security Hub finding status updatesn- Detailed logging for troubleshootingnn## Contributingnn1.
