## üß™ Testing

### Test with Sample Findings

1. **Create a test Security Hub finding**
2. **Trigger the Lambda function**
3. **Monitor CloudWatch logs**
4. **Verify SNS notifications**
5. **Check Security Hub finding status**
6. **Verify ticket creation**

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test the Lambda function locally
python -c "
import json
from enhanced_auto_remediation_lambda import lambda_handler

# Sample Security Hub event
event = {
    'detail': {
        'findings': [
            {
                'Id': 'test-finding-123',
                'Severity': {'Label': 'HIGH'},
                'ProductArn': 'arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2::product/aws/securityhub',
                'Title': 'Test Security Finding',
                'Description': 'This is a test finding for validation'
            }
        ]
    }
}

result = lambda_handler(event, None)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
"
```

### Test Ticket Integration

```bash
# Test ticket creation
python -c "
from ticket_integration_examples import TicketManager
import json

# Sample finding
finding = {
    'Id': 'test-finding-123',
    'Severity': {'Label': 'HIGH'},
    'Title': 'Test Security Finding',
    'Description': 'This is a test finding for ticket validation'
}

# Create ticket manager
ticket_manager = TicketManager()

# Create ticket
ticket_id = ticket_manager.create_ticket(finding, 'IAM')
print(f'Created ticket: {ticket_id}')

# Update ticket
ticket_manager.update_ticket(ticket_id, 'RESOLVED', 'Test resolution')
print(f'Updated ticket: {ticket_id}')
"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **IAM Permissions**: Ensure the Lambda role has all required permissions
2. **SNS Topic**: Verify the SNS topic exists and is accessible
3. **Environment Variables**: Check that all required environment variables are set
4. **Timeout Issues**: Increase the Lambda timeout for complex remediations
5. **Memory Issues**: Increase the Lambda memory for resource-intensive operations
6. **Ticket System**: Verify ticket system configuration and credentials
7. **GitHub Integration**: Check GitHub token permissions and repository access
8. **Jira Integration**: Verify Jira credentials and project access

### Debugging

1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**: Look for error messages and stack traces
2. **Verify SNS Notifications**: Ensure notifications are being sent
3. **Test Individual Functions**: Test specific remediation functions
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Check CloudWatch metrics for performance issues
5. **Check Ticket Dashboard**: Verify ticket creation and updates
6. **Test Ticket Integrations**: Verify GitHub/Jira connectivity
